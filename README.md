Business Insights 360
1. Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware is rapidly expanding and has decided to use PowerBi for the first time to execute data analytics.The Business Insights 360 dashboard should be built using Microsoft Power BI. This multi-functional dashboard should be tailored in such a way that it should provide AtliQ Hardware with vital insights into their many departments such as Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain on a worldwide scale.

About AtliQ Hardware
AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company that operates globally. They sell computer and computer accessories through three channels:

Retailers
Direct
Distributors
Recently, the company faced an unforeseen loss due to the opening of a store in Latin America. To make data-driven decisions and survive in the industry, AtliQ Hardware decided to build an analytics team.

2. Project Planning
The project planning session is where you get clarity on the project's objectives and why it's being undertaken. It's the time to ask questions and set the direction for the project and create a Project Charter

Project Charter
Using a project tool lie MURAL, which helps in creating a porject charter. It outlines kep project features such

Goals
Timeline
Team members
Objectives
Risks
3. Import & Explore Data
A. Importing Data into SQL
Importing the AtliQ's data into the MySQL Workbench. The data includes both fact and dimension tables.

B. Using SQL to Explore Data
Exploring the available data is crucial for effective analysis. Before diving into the analysis, gain a good understanding of the available data.

Dimension Tables
dim_customer
75 distinct customers throughout the market
2 types of platforms: Brick & Mortar (Physical/offline store) and E-commerce (Online Store)
Three channels: Retailer, Direct, Distributors
dim_market
27 distinct markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)
7 sub-zones
4 regions: APAC, EU, nan, LATAM
dim_product
Divisions: P & A, Peripherals, Accessories, PC, Notebook, Desktop, N & S, Networking, Storage
14 different categories (e.g., Internal HDD, keyboard)
Different variants available for the same product
Fact Tables
fact_forecast_monthly
Used to forecast the customer’s need in advance, leading to higher customer satisfaction and reduced storage costs.
Renormalized by the data engineering team for analytical work.
Dates of the month replaced by the start date of the month.
Contains forecast quantities needed by the customer.
fact_sales_monthly
Similar to the fact_forecast_monthly table, but with actual sold quantities.
Miscellaneous Data
freight_cost: Details of travel cost and other costs for each market with fiscal year
gross_price: Details of gross prices with product code
manufacturing_cost: Details of manufacturing cost with product code and year
Pre_invoice_deductions: Details of pre-invoice deductions percentage for each customer with year
Post_invoice_deductions: Details of post-invoice deductions and other deductions
Note: The Database which has both fact and dimension tables, consists of more than 1.4 Million records of different products, customers, purchases, etc..

C. Import data to Power BI
After exploring the data, we now connect and load the AtliQ's data from MySQL database to the Power BI.

Note: Excel/ CSV Files are also the other data source, where the Targets and Market Share data related informations are imported to Power BI.

4. Data Modelling
Data modeling is the foundation of the report. All visuals are built upon the data model. Poor data modeling can affect the overall performance of the report.

After importing data into the Power BI, the following procedures are to be followed:

Cleaning, formatting and transforming the data using power query
Establishing relationships among the tables, employing either Star Schema or the Snow Flake methodology.
Subsequently, conducting data validation against the benchmarks set by the stakeholders
5. Dashboard Designing
Based on mockups received as requirements, the team will start designing visuals and creating measures as needed.

Home View
In the Home view, all the view buttons will be accessible. Users will land on specific view pages by clicking the button and you can navigate to the certain view.

The different views are:

Views	Description
Info	It gives an overview of the fundamental data generation process and used to notify updates
Finance	It enables users to analyze P&L statements ,understanding the net sales and expolring other fiscal metrics
Sales	It shows a detailed analysis of sales efforts, supporting in improvement of strategy and informed decison making

Supply Chain	It provides insights into inventory levels, order fulfillments and logistics which facilitates streamlined operations
Exective	It presents some of the important KPI's and tracks market shares trends
Support	It porvides support measures for the customers who are facing issues
6. Project Outcomes
This dashboard helps with various business questions in different situations. It enables data-driven decisions to make AtliQ more profitable. It uses data to answer many 'why' questions in different scenarios.

The Goals and successes :

Views	Goals	Successes
Finance	Improve budgeting, cost control	Better budget predictions, benchmarking
Sales	Raise sales, customer relations	Sales reports, tracking KPIs
Marketing	Boost brand, data-driven marketing	Market reports, KPI tracking
Supply Chain	Optimize inventory, save costs	Forecast accuracy, key metrics
Exective	Overview for management	Real-time dashboard, revenue insights
